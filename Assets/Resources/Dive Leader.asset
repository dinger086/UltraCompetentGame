    You\u2019re awake. How long have you been asleep, here?  The ship you serve is
    quiet, non-functional. Your fellow crew, what\u2019s left of them, are in suspension.
    You love the deep, but not like this. You need to fix this ship and gather the
    raw materials to power it back to the surface.  Something is out there. Best
    do it fast. "
