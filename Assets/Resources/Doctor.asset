  description: "~9\xB0N, 29\xB0W, depth 440m:  \u2026doctor\u2026 Doctor. You\u2019re
    awake. How long have you been asleep, here?  The ship you serve is quiet, non-functional.
    Your fellow crew, what\u2019s left of them, are in suspension. Med school didn\u2019t
    prepare you for this. You need to fix this ship and gather the raw materials
    to power it back to the surface.  Something is out there. Best do it fast. "
