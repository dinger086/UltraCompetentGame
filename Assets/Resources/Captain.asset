    awake. How long have you been asleep, here?  The ship you command is quiet, non-functional.
    Your fellow crew, what\u2019s left of them, are in suspension. You\u2019re in
    charge, as usual. You need to fix this ship and gather the raw materials to power
    it back to the surface.  Something is out there. Best do it fast. "
